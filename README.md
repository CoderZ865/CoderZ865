# 👋 Hey, I’m Azeem

I’m a CSE (Data Science) student at Mar Athanasius College of Engineering, exploring how design, data, and code can come together to solve real problems.

My journey started with small Figma posters and a curious mind. Now I’m slowly building toward something deeper — tech that’s both human and helpful.
